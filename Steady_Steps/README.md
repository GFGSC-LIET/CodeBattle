Faizal is very sad and gets drunk. He wants to go home but can't walk straight. For every 3 steps forward, he takes 1 step backward.
In the 1st second, he moves 3 steps forward.
In the 2nd second, he moves 1 step backward.
In the 3rd second, he moves 3 steps forward again.
And in the 4th second, he moves 1 step backward, and so on.

How far from his starting point will Faizal be after k seconds? Assume he starts at 0.

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer k the number of seconds after which Faizal's position is to be calculated.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
0 ≤ k ≤ 100000
The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 1000000

Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - Faizal's position after k seconds.
